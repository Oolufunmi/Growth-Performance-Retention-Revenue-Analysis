# Growth-Performance-Retention-Revenue-Analysis

A cohort-based growth and revenue analysis for a financial platform, using MAU, ARPU, and retention metrics to uncover performance trends.

## 📊 Overview

This repository contains my analysis of the Growth Data Analyst Case Study, focused on analyzing user and business performance across a 16-month period.

The objective was to identify the most impactful KPIs that reflect business growth, user retention, and marketing effectiveness. The analysis was performed using two datasets:

- `01_signup.csv`: Ad spend, installs, accounts created
- `02_monthly_performance.csv`: MAUs, transactions, revenue

---

## 📂 Data Sources

- Monthly ad spend, app installs, and account creation figures.
- Used to assess marketing efficiency and acquisition trends.

### `data/02_monthly_performance.csv`

###Aditional Information about the dataset
  two primary datasets were used for this Growth Data Analysis case study:

- 01_signup.csv: Contains monthly digital ad spend, app installs, and new accounts created.
- 02_monthly_performance.csv: Contains monthly user activity metrics, revenue, transaction count, and cohort-based MAUs.
