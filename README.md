# Growth Data Analysis Case Study

This repository contains my solution to the Growth Data Analyst Case Study, focused on analyzing user and business performance across a 16-month period.

## 📊 Overview

The objective was to identify the most impactful KPIs that reflect business growth, user retention, and marketing effectiveness. The analysis was performed using two datasets:

- `01_signup.csv`: Ad spend, installs, accounts created
- `02_monthly_performance.csv`: MAUs, transactions, revenue

## ✅ Key KPIs Analyzed

1. **Monthly Active Users (MAUs)** – Core growth metric
2. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** – Monetization efficiency
3. **Total Transaction Value** – Platform usage depth
4. **Marketing Spend Efficiency** – % change in ad spend vs MAU growth
5. **[Bonus] Retention Rate** – Cohort stickiness across months

## 📈 Tools & Approach

- Data visualization (Tableau/Excel)
- Metric calculations
- Cohort analysis
- Business storytelling

## 📂 Contents
