# Growth Data Analysis Case Study

This repository contains my solution to the Growth Data Analyst Case Study, focused on analyzing user and business performance across a 16-month period.

## 📊 Overview

The objective was to identify the most impactful KPIs that reflect business growth, user retention, and marketing effectiveness. The analysis was performed using two datasets:

- `01_signup.csv`: Ad spend, installs, accounts created
- `02_monthly_performance.csv`: MAUs, transactions, revenue
  
## 📂 Data Sources

### `data/01_signup.csv`
- Monthly ad spend, app installs, and account creation figures.
- Used to assess marketing efficiency and acquisition trends.

### `data/02_monthly_performance.csv`
- Cohort-based user activity data including MAUs, transactions, revenue.
- Used for retention analysis, ARPU calculation, and transaction trends.
